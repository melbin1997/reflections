When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 	When we do a project as a team, we need remote repository so that all the members can view the progress.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If we are doing the project in a team, then we need to only pull the files when we need to as other people can change the file.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	 Fork is used to clone another persons repository onto our account, so that we can make changes or add features in our version.
	 Clones are used for having the files and commit history from Github to local computer or local to local computer.
	 Branches are used so that we can fix a bug or add new experimental features to the file without breaking the whole program.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	So that we can change the file when we are offline.
